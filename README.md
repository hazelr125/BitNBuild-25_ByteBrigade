## 🚀 About the Project

**GigCampus** is a two-sided, campus-specific freelance marketplace that connects student freelancers with local clients—clubs, administration, and nearby businesses. GigCampus handles the entire project lifecycle:

- Project posting  
- Student bidding  
- Secure payments  
- Real-time chat/collaboration  
- Reputation building through ratings  

_No more untapped student skills! Empower your campus community with trusted, local gigs._

## 🏅 Key Features

- **Local project posting:** Clients post opportunities and get matched with talented student freelancers.
- **Secure bidding:** Students bid on projects; clients can review profiles and ratings before awarding.
- **End-to-end payments:** All transactions managed securely on-platform.
- **Messaging:** Built-in chat for collaboration and clarity.
- **Trust & reputation:** Ratings for both students and clients, promoting accountability and growth.
- **Hyperlocal:** Focused on college campuses—tailored for student needs and trust.

## 💡 Why GigCampus?

Campus skills often go unrecognized—the best web developer, designer, or event planner might already be in your college. Local clubs, administration, and businesses need reliable, affordable talent but lack a trustworthy channel.

GigCampus fills this gap by making it easy, transparent, and verified—without global freelancing complexity.
